"""
Orchestrate and cache the full lowering-to-shared-object pipeline.

Wires lowering, driver synthesis, ``llvm-link``, the Enzyme ``opt``
pass, and the final shared-object compile into a single call, and
caches built ``.so`` files on disk, keyed on the function's source text
and a fingerprint of the toolchain used to build it.

    Find the running process's own loaded libc/libm, via ``/proc/self/maps``.

    Used only for the vendored-crt link path (see `build`): a vendored
    toolchain ships its own crt startup objects and a static `libgcc`,
    but deliberately does not vendor libc/libm themselves. Every Linux
    target that can run this Python process at all has *already*
    loaded some libc into it by the time this runs, so reading its own
    memory map back is a distro/layout-agnostic way to find the exact
    file to link against -- unlike hardcoding a path convention such
    as Debian's ``/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/``, which doesn't exist on e.g.
    Fedora/RHEL/Arch. For instance a link built this way on
    Debian trixie produces a shared object whose only `NEEDED` entries
    are ``libc.so.6``/``libm.so.6``.

    Returns
    -------

    compiles the result to a shared object with ``clang``. If an
    identical build (same source text and toolchain fingerprint) is
    already cached on disk, the cached one is returned without any
    subprocess calls.
